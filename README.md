# Etch-A-Sketch
For this project I've build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. This project was part of The Odin Project curriculum and aims to improve skills in DOM manipulation.

* **Resizing**: Use the slider to resize the grid.
* **Color selection**: Use the color picker to choose colors for your drawing.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3

This project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end functionality. Bootstrap Icons was used to display the eraser icon on the Eraser button.

## Future features
Some possible featues to improve this application in the future include:
* **Save images**: Add a functionality to sace the drawing as an image file.
* **Paint bucket**: Add a feature that allows the user to fill a region with a color.
